Thrilled you are here to learn more about me! I'm Pragnath, a passionate developer and an informatics student at the University of Washington with a focus on software development. I enjoy problem-solving to develop simple and innovative solutions for complex problems that create impact.

Ever since the very first programming workshop I attended in middle school, I've been amazed by how much of an impact every single line of code can have on the final product.

I have experience with developing full stack applications, both web and mobile (iOS). I've been able to improve my skillset ranging across multiple programming languages, databases and frameworks due to projects offerred through coursework and my personal projects. I am always looking for exciting software development opportunities that can help me learn more and make an organization win at the same time.
